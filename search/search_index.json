Upon returning to the U.S. in 2019, I now support the Petersen HIV Clinics in the College of Medicine as a Data Specialist, Senior. </p> <p>My passions are database development and ensuring collected data support the clinical project or program. I hope to leverage clinical trial metadata to better inform clinical researchers of their project\u2019s status, improve data quality, and provide enhanced monitoring techniques.</p>"},{"location":"installation/","title":"Installation and Requirements","text":"<p>Instructions to install</p>"},{"location":"manual/","title":"User Manual","text":"<p>Manual</p>"}]}
